            <h4>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</h4>
            <p>Where I learned the fundamentals of Computer Science and understained how complex and beautiful is this area. 
                More than this, the variety and creative solutions designed are inspiring. We can look backward and see how things evolved.. It's magnificent.</p>
            <p>
                My undergraduate thesis was a study and implementation of a software that can convert a image into HTML and CSS using Digital Image Processing and OCR techniques.
                Divs, images and texts are extracted from png image (generated by a web designer in Photoshop like apps). That time was how the things were done (a web designer make the UI design, a developer slices and build these divs, images and texts based on image prototype). My idea and intention was automate this proces.

                            A mobile solution with machine learning to recognize student cars with the specific college sticker and car license plate. 
                            A neural network was trained with Tensorflow and dataset was builded with pictures taked from student cars.
                        <p>
                        <p>
                            One neural network was trained to recognize the sticker, and other to recognize the letters and numbers of car license plate. 
                        A Flutter app was developed with Tensorflow Lite to use the trained neural network.

                            Semiannually students must going to college to check these sticker, but with this app, this process can be automated. The app assertiveness was very high.
